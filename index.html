        Hi there, and thank you for visiting my site! My name is John Rumler, and I'm a 4th year computer science student at
        Michigan State University studying Computer Science through the College of Engineering. My passions for work lie
        in Software Design and the Information Technology field, while in my free time I enjoy game design as a hobby.
        On my own, I learned the lua scripting language in order to make modifications for games I enjoy, and in school
        I've had a varied curriculum learning Python, C++, C, Arm Assembly, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Java -
        finding most enjoyment in object-oriented programming. I'm actively looking for jobs in software, and hope to gain
        experience in the field after my graduation in May. My hobbies outside of programming are playing tennis, swimming,
        hiking, camping, and fishing.
      </p>
